## Blockers & Dependencies

1. **Browser API limitations** - Research needed on Firefox and Safari extension APIs to ensure cross-browser compatibility
2. **Key management approach** - Decision needed on secure key storage approach before implementing user authentication
3. **Performance testing** - Need to establish baseline metrics before optimization tasks

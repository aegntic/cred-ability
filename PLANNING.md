# CRED-ABILITY Project Planning

## 🔑 Golden Rules

### Documentation-First Approach
- Use markdown files for all project documentation and management
- Keep each file under 500 lines for optimal readability
- Document code, APIs, and architecture decisions thoroughly

### Conversation Management
- Start fresh conversations for new features or components
- Focus on completing one task per message
- Be explicit in requests and responses

### Code Quality Standards
- Implement comprehensive test coverage
- Keep functions concise and single-purpose
- Follow security best practices, especially for credential handling
- Use meaningful variable/function names

### Environment & Security
- Never hardcode credentials
- Use environment variables for all sensitive information
- Implement proper encryption for stored credentials

## Project Scope & Objectives

CRED-ABILITY aims to revolutionize credential management by creating an intelligent system that:

1. **Seamlessly detects credentials** across digital platforms with minimal user friction
2. **Analyzes credential context** to understand relationships and dependencies
3. **Provides actionable security recommendations** for credential management
4. **Secures credentials** with defense-in-depth encryption strategies
5. **Minimizes user friction** through intelligent automation

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Browser API limitations | High | Medium | Multiple detection strategies, graceful degradation |
| Encryption performance | Medium | Low | Caching strategies, hardware acceleration support |
| False positive overload | High | Medium | Confidence tuning, machine learning improvements |
| Integration challenges | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive integration testing, clear API contracts |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Regular security audits, penetration testing, secure coding practices |
| User adoption friction | Medium | Medium | Focus on UX, minimal manual intervention, clear value proposition |

## Technical Debt Strategy

### Current Technical Debt
- Error handling could be more comprehensive across components
- In-memory storage is not suitable for production
- Test coverage is incomplete
- Security for the API layer needs enhancement
- Documentation needs code examples for implementation

### Planned Technical Debt Reduction
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging framework
- Integrate database persistence with proper migration system
- Increase test coverage to >80% for all core components
- Add authentication middleware to API layer
- Create code examples and demos for documentation

## Performance Targets

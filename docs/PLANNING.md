# CRED-ABILITY Project Planning

## Project Scope and Objectives

CRED-ABILITY is a credential management ecosystem designed to transform how digital identities and sensitive credentials are captured, managed, and secured across platforms.

### Primary Objectives

1. Develop a seamless credential capture system with browser integration
2. Create a secure credential vault with zero-knowledge architecture
3. Implement an intelligence layer for context analysis and security recommendations
4. Establish a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for unified communication
5. Provide a frictionless user experience with proactive security features

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- TypeScript
- React for management interfaces
- Browser Extension APIs (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Backend
- Node.js with TypeScript
- Express.js for API services
- Jest for testing
- Docker for containerization

### Security
- AES-256 for encryption
- Argon2 for key derivation
- Zero-knowledge authentication mechanisms
- Role-based access control

### Data Management
- PostgreSQL for structured data
- Redis for caching and session management

## Timeline and Milestones

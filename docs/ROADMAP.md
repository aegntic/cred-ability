# CRED-ABILITY Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
CRED-ABILITY is a comprehensive credential management ecosystem designed to transform how digital credentials are detected, managed, and secured with intelligent context analysis and proactive security recommendations.

## Current Status: Foundation Phase Complete

![Roadmap Status: 40% Complete](https://progress-bar.dev/40/)

## Completed Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4) âœ“
- [x] Initial project setup and documentation
- [x] Core architecture implementation
- [x] Basic browser integration engine with detection patterns
- [x] MCP server skeleton and processing pipeline
- [x] Credential vault with encryption services
- [x] Intelligence layer with context analysis

### Key Achievements
- Comprehensive documentation (6 core documents)
- Modular system architecture with clear component boundaries
- Strong security foundation with AES-256 encryption and Argon2id key derivation
- Intelligence-driven credential analysis and recommendation engine
- Unit test coverage for all core components

## Current Phase: Core Functionality (Weeks 5-8)

### In Progress
- [ ] Browser extension frontend implementation (20%)
- [ ] API integration between components (40%)
- [ ] Database integration for persistent storage (10%)
- [ ] User authentication and authorization system (15%)

### Up Next (4 weeks)
- [ ] Complete browser extension UI
- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement database persistence layer
- [ ] Build user management system
- [ ] Develop dashboard for credential visualization
- [ ] Create automated credential rotation workflows

## Upcoming Phases

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)
- [ ] Machine learning enhancements for detection accuracy
- [ ] Advanced context analysis capabilities
- [ ] Service-specific credential handlers
- [ ] Multi-browser support expansion
- [ ] Integration with external secret management systems
- [ ] Real-time notification system for security events

### Phase 4: Compliance and Deployment (Weeks 13-16)
- [ ] Compliance modules for GDPR, CCPA
- [ ] Audit trail and reporting features
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Final security review and penetration testing
- [ ] Production deployment pipeline
- [ ] Documentation refinement and user guides

## Key Metrics & Targets
- Detection accuracy: Target 95% (currently estimated at 85%)
- False positive rate: Target <1% (currently estimated at 3%)
- Capture latency: Target <50ms (currently ~100ms)
- System response time: Target <200ms (currently ~350ms)

## Technical Debt
- Improved error handling needed across components
- Performance optimization for real-time detection
- Better abstraction for storage interfaces
- Enhanced logging for debugging and audit

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Browser API limitations | High | Medium | Multiple detection strategies, graceful degradation |
| Encryption performance | Medium | Low | Caching strategies, hardware acceleration support |
| False positive overload | High | Medium | Confidence tuning, machine learning improvements |
| Integration challenges | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive integration testing, clear API contracts |

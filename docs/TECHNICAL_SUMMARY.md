## Technical Insights

### Security Architecture
The system utilizes a defense-in-depth approach:

1. **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for credentials with envelope encryption
2. **Key Management**: Hierarchical key structure (Master Key → Key Encryption Keys → Data Encryption Keys)
3. **Authentication**: Argon2id for key derivation with configurable parameters
4. **Zero-Knowledge Design**: Client-side encryption where possible
5. **Compartmentalization**: Separation of detection, storage, and analysis

### Intelligence Architecture
The intelligence layer uses a multi-staged approach:

1. **Context Analysis**: Initial credential assessment for type, service, and usage
2. **Relationship Mapping**: Building a graph of dependencies and relationships
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating the risk profile based on multiple factors
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Creating prioritized, actionable security recommendations

### Key Technical Challenges

| Challenge | Current Status | Planned Solution |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Real-time detection performance | Basic implementation | Optimize with worker threads, caching |
| Accuracy of service detection | Pattern-based | Add ML-based classification |
| Secure key storage | In-memory only | HSM integration, secure enclaves |
| Browser API limitations | Basic implementation | Develop fallback strategies |
| Cross-component communication | REST defined, not implemented | Add WebSocket for real-time events |

## Technical Debt

### Current Technical Debt
- Error handling could be more comprehensive across components
- In-memory storage is not suitable for production
- Test coverage is incomplete
- Security for the API layer needs enhancement
- Documentation needs code examples for implementation

### Planned Technical Debt Reduction
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging framework
- Integrate database persistence with proper migration system
- Increase test coverage to >80% for all core components
- Add authentication middleware to API layer
- Create code examples and demos for documentation

# TASKS.md Status Update Plan

## Objective
Review the current task list in `TASKS.md`, identify which tasks have been completed and which are still pending, and update the status of each task to accurately reflect their current progress based on the contents of the `cred-ability` directory.

---

## 1. Review and Status Update Approach

- For each task in `TASKS.md`, cross-reference the codebase and documentation to determine its likely status:
  - Mark as ✅ DONE if there is clear evidence of completion.
  - Mark as 🔄 IN PROGRESS if there is partial implementation or work underway.
  - Mark as ⏱️ PLANNED if there is no evidence of work started.
  - Mark as ⏱️ BACKLOG if it is still a future/low-priority task.

flowchart TD
    A[Review TASKS.md] --> B[Cross-reference codebase/docs]
    B --> C{Task implemented?}
    C -- Yes, complete --> D[Mark as DONE]
    C -- Partial/started --> E[Mark as IN PROGRESS]
    C -- Not started --> F[Mark as PLANNED/BACKLOG]
    D & E & F --> G[Update TASKS.md status fields]
```

## 4. Next Steps

- Update `TASKS.md` status fields as per the above plan.
- Optionally, include a summary table of changes for transparency.

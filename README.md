# CRED-ABILITY

A revolutionary credential management ecosystem designed to transform how digital identities and sensitive credentials are captured, managed, and secured across digital platforms.

## Vision

CRED-ABILITY is more than just a password manager. It's an intelligent, contextual credential management system that provides:

- Seamless credential capture with minimal user friction
- Intelligent context analysis to understand credential relationships
- Proactive security recommendations to enhance digital security
- Defense-in-depth encryption with zero-knowledge architecture

## Core Components

CRED-ABILITY is built on four primary pillars:

1. **Browser Integration Engine**: Automatically detects and captures credentials across web applications
2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server**: Processes credential events and coordinates between components
3. **Credential Vault**: Securely stores and manages encrypted credentials using AES-256-GCM
4. **Intelligence Layer**: Analyzes context and generates security recommendations

## Current Status

The project is currently in active development, with the Foundation Phase completed and the Core Functionality Phase in progress. We've established a solid architecture and implemented key security features, with a focus on completing the user interface and persistent storage next.

- Foundation Phase: ✓ Completed
- Core Functionality Phase: 🔄 In Progress (40% complete)
- Advanced Features Phase: ⏱️ Scheduled
- Compliance & Deployment Phase: ⏱️ Scheduled

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cred-ability.git
cd cred-ability

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific component tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=browser-integration
```

## Security Architecture

CRED-ABILITY implements defense-in-depth security:

- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for credential encryption
- **Key Management**: Hierarchical key structure with envelope encryption
- **Authentication**: Argon2id for secure key derivation
- **Zero-Knowledge Design**: Client-side encryption where possible
- **Compartmentalization**: Strict separation between detection, storage, and analysis

## Development Workflow

1. Check `TASKS.md` for current priorities and available tasks
2. Branch from `develop` using naming convention: `feature/feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-name`
3. Develop following TDD approach and project coding standards
4. Submit PR with reference to task ID and comprehensive description
5. Update documentation as needed
